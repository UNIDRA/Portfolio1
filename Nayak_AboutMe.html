        <p style='padding-left: 70px;' class='float-right'>Anmol Nayak is a hard-working Dublin High School Freshman that always tries to challenge himself and go above and beyond for himself. He plans to someday be an independent video game designer and takes many measures in order to achieve that goal. <br><br>Currently, he is familiarizing himself with multiple different game developing programs such as Unity and Craft Studio. He is incredibly motivated and determined to do work the best he can and can only be happy about his work if he tries his absolute best. He learns and becomes inspired by others who work with technology and has a shown interest in creating software. <br><br>Anmol first started to work with code and technology when he took his first class with the coding school, Youngwonks. The school taught him how to think about the problems faced in coding and how to work with peers. Currently, he is a CSP student who is learning teamwork skills as well as the history of technology. He hopes that his future will become a bright one, and that he can create something that he could truly be proud of.</p> <!--This paragraph is an element that contains information about Anmol Nayak-->
