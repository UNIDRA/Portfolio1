        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>During my time in the Engineering Academy, I had the opportunity to listen to many people and travel to many places. These experiences allowed me to gain ideas and experience on what I could do and be in the future. Here are four major instances where I got valuable experience.</p>

        <h2>Field Trips</h2>
        <p>One of the field trips that I’ve benefited from was my field trip to San Jose State University. San Jose State University is an esteemed college and is the founding campus of the California State University system. During my visit at the university, I was able to learn about the work ethic, the time management and time commitment I need in order to succeed in college. Another field trip I went on was the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is a research facility where their mission is to strengthen the United States’ security through the use of science and technology. Here I learned about the various ways my own life could move forward, and I especially learned about the different pathways I could take if I were to improve my skills over the next few years.</p>

        <h2>Guest Speakers</h2>
        <p>One of the guest speakers I’ve had the chance to listen to was Gagan Thapar. He is a Dublin High School Alumni that was accepted to and is currently a Junior at CalPoly SOL and majors in aerospace engineering. From him I was able to understand the various ways I can utilize the skills I’m learning to work on interesting engineering projects. I also had the opportunity to listen to Hanna Li. She is another alumni from Dublin High School that now goes to and is a Junior at UC Berkeley where she is an architecture major. From her, I was able to understand what I need to show in order to reach one of the top schools like UC Berkeley.</p>

        <h2>On Field Experience</h2>
        <p>During my time in high school, I have had various opportunities to volunteer. The place I’ve enjoyed working the most was the John Green Elementary School. Even though I had minor jobs such as supervising the auction stand and taking pictures of families, I did the best work I could. The staff working there recognized my effort and praised me for it. During these two volunteer opportunities, I was able to show my tenacity to do even tedious tasks for hours without stop. </p>
