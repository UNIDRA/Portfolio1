      <h3>Field Trips</h3>
      <p>Our CSP class had the opportunity to visit two spectacular colleges. One was San Jose University while the other was Santa Clara University. These two colleges gave us an insight on what we will be achieving after high school. These two colleges also taught us what to look for when choosing a college. Our guides gave us an overview on the campus and explained the benefits of going to both colleges. Without this field trip, I wouldn’t have gotten a keen eye for which colleges I should go to. It was an amazing experience to see the insides of a college and will definitely help me in deciding my future college.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Guest Speakers</h3>
      <p>During my time as a CSP student, we have had many people come into our class and discuss their prefered topic. These guest speakers provide students, such as myself, a chance to understand an important topic that they are passionate about. One such guest speaker was very close to how I saw myself in the future. He was a software engineer for many great EA titles, some of which I had played. I talked about the process of developing a game and how software engineers had to adapt to the vision of their superiors. Another guest speaker talked about managing a start-up business. Guest speaker Joe Vierra provided his experiences working in start-up and how we should deal with them. These wonderful speakers provided me with insight into the computer science industry, an industry that one day I would be a part of.</p> <br><br>
      <h3>Mentor Program</h3>
      <p>Please await for this section to be updated as my mentor program has yet to happen. Thank you for your patience.</p> <br><br>
      <h3>Volunteer Experience</h3>
      <p>Currently, I’ve had experience with multiple volunteer opportunities. I have always volunteered at schools. At these locations, I always worked the best I could and was always filled with enjoyment. I enjoyed working with the people there and always helped in any way possible. During the volunteering opportunities, I was able to demonstrate my positive attitude during constant work, my enthusiasm in the work I was doing, and the ability to persevere during long hours of work.</p> <br><br>
