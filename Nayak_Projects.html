        <h2>MIT App Inventor Moblie App: PaintPotPro</h2>
        <h4>Partner: Renxiang(James) Wu</h4>
        <h5>Started: 9/23/19 Ended: 10/9/19</h5>
        <p>It was our objective to make an application for the andriod tablet we had in class, and we had to make the application in MIT App Inventor. MIT App Inventor is a block-based coding website where the user can create different apps using different combinations of blocks. The twist was that we had to make a program out of one the existing tutorials and "remix" or upgrade the tutorial program already existing on their website. We decided to choose the painting app tutorial and brainstormed many ideas to implement before going in to code. This project taught us how to split work evenly and how to be as efficient and orgainized as possible so that others could easily understand our code.</p>

        <h2>Scratch: Princess Story</h2>
        <h4>Partner: Sruti Mani</h4>
        <h5>Started: 9/4/19 Ended: 9/11/19</h5>
        <p>It was our first ever project done in CSP class and I was able to learn how I can program with others simultaneously. We were able to come to a compromise of story and game letting us make what we wanted to make. While my partner was working on the story, I created a game that was planned to be implemented halfway thru the story. Although the implementation of the game wasn't able to work and was left unfinished, we were able to make the quick decision to scrap the game so we could have a finished product.</p>
