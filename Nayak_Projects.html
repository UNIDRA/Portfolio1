        <p>This product is an attempt to make a permanent change in our school. We wanted to develop a website that would allow clubs to increase their membership and increase participation in clubs. Our website showcases all of our school's clubs so that students will be aware of the communities that are a part of this school. This is an ongoing project.</p>

        <p>The Escape Room Project was one of our large java projects given by the PLTW program. The project tested our skills in programming in the Java language. Our task was to create a unique game based on the template that was given. In our game specifically, the user had to collect all the coins in order to win the game, and the game would count the steps of the user and find how many steps it took to win the game.

        <h6>Started: 11/9/2020 Ended: 12/4/2020</h6>
        <p>The Compound Machine: Santa Capture project was a project where we were given an imaginary situation where we needed to capture Santa utilizing various simple machines and combine them into one machine. My specific task was to make the end of the machine, therefore I had to create a method of capturing Santa. I used a simple lever that would lift Santa and tie his leg to a rope. This project was rather difficult to coordinate because the duration of time forced us to work during the Thanksgiving Break. Even with this obstacle, we were able to make quality prototypes that showed our expertise in the ideas and principles that were required to create this project.</p>

        <h2>The Bridge Project</h2>

        <p>It was our assignment to design a bridge that would allow for a truck to pass through the bridge. As a group, we wanted to make the cheapest bridge that could still support the truck without breaking. We all spent our time making the best bridge that fits within these limits. I was able to build the final bridge that was one of the cheapest by using a building technique of muscles. Muscles acted as a stronger beam that can support more weight because it divided the stress into two pathways instead of one, allowing the high stress areas to take on more stress than they could.</p>

        <h6>Started: 9/4/19 Ended: 9/11/19</h6>
        <p>It was our first ever project done in CSP class and I was able to learn how I can program with others simultaneously. We were able to come to a compromise of story and game letting us make what we wanted to make. While my partner was working on the story, I created a game that was planned to be implemented halfway thru the story. Although the implementation of the game wasn't able to work and was left unfinished, we were able to make the quick decision to scrap the game so we could have a finished product.</p>

        <h2>MIT App Inventor Moblie App: PaintPotPro</h2>
        <h4>Partner: Renxiang(James) Wu</h4>
        <h5>CSP</h5>
        <h6>Started: 9/23/19 Ended: 10/9/19</h6>
        <p>It was our objective to make an application for the andriod tablet we had in class, and we had to make the application in MIT App Inventor. MIT App Inventor is a block-based coding website where the user can create different apps using different combinations of blocks. The twist was that we had to make a program out of one the existing tutorials and "remix" or upgrade the tutorial program already existing on their website. We decided to choose the painting app tutorial and brainstormed many ideas to implement before going in to code. This project taught us how to split work evenly and how to be as efficient and orgainized as possible so that others could easily understand our code.</p>
